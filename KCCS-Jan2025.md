# Creating a user-centric, dynamic categorisation system for Kiwix - the KCCS (Kiwix Content Classification System)

## Aims and scope

### A quick overview (using the ‚ÄúSTAR‚Äù framework)

**Situation ‚Äî** Kiwix currently has a highly heterogeneous, format-oriented tagging system that is inefficient for supporting content discovery. 
Task‚ÄîContent-oriented classification (tagging, in the technical sense) was identified as a possible solution. ‚Üí Adapting and aiding the adoption of a classification system for Kiwix with a community-first approach and high emphasis on conciseness, flexibility, and extensibility.
 
**Action ‚Äî** A content-oriented classification system was conceived based on currently used library classification systems, analysis of current Kiwix content, and internal feedback. Layers of necessary classification (tagging) were identified (classification, language, technical, and community tags). Based on conversations with the lead developer, [a UX system and mockup UI](./UI%20MockUp%20Jan2025.excalidraw.png) have been developed to aid the implementation. Additionally, the consultant conducted a proof-of-concept tagging of current content and tested it with a simple content distribution analysis to analyse how the new classification system behaves when applied to real-world content. 

**Result (~deliverables)**
- This document. 
- A series of GitHub issues for the development team (to be delivered - needs an additional consultation regarding the issue structure and details required).
- Classification guide
- Guidelines to create and change community tags.
- [Basic UI mockup](./UI%20MockUp%20Jan2025.excalidraw.png). 


### A look from a project management perspective

**People -** Beno√Æt, Stephane, Attila, Community members (crowd-sourced community tags) (so far)

**Process -** Creating the classification system and tagging structure ‚Üí Classification system freeze (December) ‚Üí Proof of Concept - testing the system on a random sample of zims (in progress, as it leads to subtle changes to the classification system) ‚Üí Classification distribution analysis - how the zims get distributed between the classification tags, longtail-like distribution expected, but ideally it should be closer to a ‚Äúbell curve‚Äù around 1. Education and Reference) ‚Üí UI and UX focused meeting (around secondary deliverable from consultant) ‚Üí GitHub issues to aid development (into January) ‚Üí Implementing suggestions from community members, acting on internal feedback ‚Üí Implementation (hopefully üôÇ)

**Product -** An extensible, concise categorisation system and a redesigned cross-platform browsing functionality aiding content discovery on Kiwix.

## About the proposed classification system
(WIP!)

KCCS is inspired in its heading structure by the **Library of Congress** and **Universal Decimal Classification** systems widely used in libraries. However, it **rationalises the main categories** and brings them to the 21st century. 

In the case of the KCCS, there are no empty classes or separate headings for subjects commonly considered a subfield or a larger classification unit. For example, there is no separate top-level heading for Philosophy or Mathematics. Instead, these are categorised under *Culture and Heritage*, and *Science*, respectively. 

There was an internal consensus that the system should be user-focused. As a result, it does not follow strict scientific classification or established librarianship conventions. Instead, it focuses on enhancing the user experience by **putting descriptive subject headings right in front of the user, attempting to follow real-world user needs and amplify common-sense usage patterns**. For instance, the *‚Äú3. Science & Technology‚Äù* section has a separate second-level category called *‚Äú3.2. Technology‚Äù*. Someone could argue that this could‚Äôve been included in the *‚Äú3.3. Applied Sciences‚Äù* second-level category, possibly even in the *‚Äú3.3.1. Engineering and Architecture‚Äù* third-level category, but considering the abundance of material, the popularity and future prospects of the field, the establishment of a separate second-level category seemed justified. Compared to established classification systems, KCCS is simplified and as concise as possible. However, it still tries to be all-encompassing, just like the content Kiwix serves to its users.

Kiwix content is highly multidisciplinary, and many ZIMs can be considered reference works. Some content can be regarded as popular science, while others can be considered scientific. Except 1.1.1. Comprehensive Encyclopedias, the classification system facilitates content discovery by adding the optimal number of appropriate tags to each ZIM.

The optimal number of classification items shall be defined as such: **allow for enough coverage to make the item discoverable across various searches while avoiding excessive granularity that may complicate retrieval or overwhelm or confuse users**.

As an arbitrary guideline, the KCCS should aim for a **minimum of 1 and a maximum of 5 classification tags**.
	
- The focus is on precision and relevance rather than breadth.
- Multiple tags should only be added if the item significantly connects with different fields of study but cannot be included in 1.1.1. Comprehensive Encyclopedias.

**The key is to choose classification tags that are both highly relevant and varied enough to capture different aspects of the item‚Äôs content, audience, and context. The number of appropriate tags shall be decided by the team member responsible for ZIM classification, keeping internal and community feedback in mind.**


## Technical considerations

### Content tagging

**Classification tags -** tags from our classification system that efficiently describe our content - can be up to 5; otherwise, the content is in `1.1. Encyclopedias, Reference Works, Educational Resources & Multidisciplinary Works and General Knowledge`

**Technical tags -** tags about form and ‚Äúphysical‚Äù properties, like contained media and file size - one can be added from every category.

**Community tags** are crowd-sourced; they help the community reveal otherwise hidden use cases and meanings. Multiple can be added.

**Language tags -** denoting content language - multiple can be added.

**Tags allow flexible navigation, act as search filters, and enable dynamic updating as new content is added. The numbers in front of the categories only serve as unique identifiers in the metadata; they are generally hidden from the users,** and the translations of the key-translation value pairs are shown instead. So, instead of 1.1.2, the user only sees ‚ÄúSpecialised Encyclopedias‚Äù or ‚ÄúEncyclop√©dies sp√©cialis√©es,‚Äù depending on their UI language settings. *(NOTA: Changing them to Object Identifiers (OIDs) is under discussion)*

**ZIM files will be tagged with their respective category (multiple possible), subcategory (multiple possible), technical tag(s), language tag(s), and an arbitrary number of community tags for ‚Äúcrowd-enhanced discoverability‚Äù.**

An example: PhET Interactive Simulations are tagged with the 1.2.1. Natural Sciences, 1.1.4. Knowledge as Entertainment, 3.1.1. Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Earth Sciences. Kiwix team members add the classification, language, and technical tags. Still, we cannot possibly cover all community use cases, so a **particular group of community members should have the right to add so-called ‚Äúcommunity tags‚Äù**. For example, John Appleseed is a community member aware that many people use specific PhET simulations for complex unit conversion, so he adds ‚Äúunit-conversion‚Äù as a community tag. (There is no predefined dictionary for community tags. It mainly relies on community self-regulation. In true Wiki fashion, **Kiwix team members and/or trusted community members should vet community tags before becoming public.)**

### User Experience Enhancements

(compared to the current, largely format-only discovery system)

**Hierarchical, content-based browsing:** Users can explore categories via a tree structure without typing, no matter what type of device they use. This also means that they don‚Äôt need to know a search term to reach relevant content; they just need basic knowledge of the domain in which they are interested.

**Future enhancement - Search Integration:** Keyword searches linked to metadata tags for precise results and maybe even search suggestions.

**Possibility to discover subjects from multiple angles and easy cross-referencing:** Related resources are connected on the content level across categories for a seamless browsing experience.

**Extensibility** and **future-proofing**
- New categories can be added as Kiwix content grows.
- Specialized topics or interdisciplinary resources are easily discoverable.
- User-driven customisation, such as institutional or regional needs. (A topic to explore in the future - regionally customised home pages? User-aware homepages could be a thing, but they come with additional tracking needs, something Kiwix is not in the business of doing, as far as I can tell.)

**A subject-based** or **content-based** categorisation system provides a robust framework for organising Kiwix content. It prioritises user accessibility, supports discovery and exploration, and ensures scalability for future growth. The hope is by adopting this system, Kiwix can enhance its mission of making knowledge accessible to all, offline and beyond.

### Possible ‚Äúdangers‚Äù, drawbacks and shortcomings

**The following possible negative effects or shortcomings of the system have been identified so far:**
- Significant development overhead for developer(s), possibly to the detriment of other development areas.
- Retroactive tagging, after the initial tagging, requires human resources and frequent interaction with the community (possibly a positive thing, as it can lead to a great collaborative effort)
- A laissez-faire approach with the community tags can lead to a chaotic landscape of tagging, with the possibility of inappropriate tags appearing on the platform (a centralised check from a content and/or community manager, or a ‚Äúpeer-review‚Äù system is needed before public tag availability)
- Community concerns related to the unorthodox structure of the classification system (headers not corresponding with established systems, leading to some confusion to people aware of their existence, approx. 5-10% of users)
- Leaving out or making it hard to classify a socially or politically sensitive subject
- If a serious shortcoming is identified after the initial classification, changing the system and reclassifying content can take a lot of resources. (A drawback of the precoordinated approach.)

## Guide to Modifying the Kiwix Classification System

### Structural Overview

The classification system follows a three-level decimal hierarchy, which can be extended horizontally and vertically to accommodate new categories and disciplines:
- Level 1: Major categories (e.g., "1. Education & Reference")
- Level 2: Sub-categories (e.g., "1.1. Encyclopedias, Reference Works...")
- Level 3: Specific topics (e.g., "1.1.1. Comprehensive Encyclopedias")
- (Level 4 would be 1.1.1.1, and so on. - not implemented, currently probably not needed.)

### Modification Procedures

#### Adding New Elements

**Adding a Level 1 Category**

1. Identify the appropriate position in the sequence
1. Avoid shifting existing categories
1. Assign the next available number
1. Format: `N. Category Name`

Adding a new major category after `7. News, Current Affairs & Society`:

```
8. Digital Media & Communications
```

**Adding a Level 2 Sub-category**

1. Identify the parent category
2. Use the decimal format: N.M
3. Avoid shifting existing categories

Under `3. Science & Technology`:

```
3.4. Data Science
````

**Adding a Level 3 Topic**

1. Use the full decimal notation: N.M.L
1. Avoid shifting existing categories

**Under `3.4. Data Science`:

```
3.4.1. Machine Learning Resources
3.4.2. Statistical Analysis Tools
3.4.3. Big Data Technologies
````

#### Removing Elements

**Pre-removal Checklist**

- Identify all content tagged with the classification
- Plan for content redistribution
- Document cross-references
- Backup the current structure

**Level 3 Topic Removal**

1. Remove the specific entry
1. Renumber remaining topics if necessary (try to avoid this)
1. Redistribute associated content (possibly create an alias and redirect content to other tags.)

Removing `1.1.4. Knowledge as Entertainment`:

```
1.1.1. Comprehensive Encyclopedias
1.1.2. Specialised Encyclopedias
1.1.3. Language & Grammar
[1.1.4 removed, no renumbering needed if last item]
```

**Level 2 Sub-category Removal**

1. Ensure all Level 3 topics are addressed first
2. Remove the sub-category
3. Renumber subsequent sub-categories (try to avoid this)
4. Update all related cross-references

**Level 1 Category Removal (It‚Äôs unlikely this will be needed. Try to avoid this.)**

1. Address all sub-categories and topics first
2. Remove the major category
3. Renumber all subsequent categories
4. Update all documentation and references

#### Rearranging Elements (probably not needed)

**Moving Topics Within Same Sub-category**

1. Maintain the decimal structure
2. Update numbering sequentially

Before:

```
3.1.1. Mathematics
3.1.2. Physics
3.1.3. Chemistry
```

After (moving Mathematics):

```
3.1.1. Physics
3.1.2. Chemistry
3.1.3. Mathematics
````

**Moving Sub-categories**

1. Ensure proper decimal alignment
2. Update all internal references

#### Best Practices

**Content Management**

- Maintain consistent format
- Document all changes in a changelog

**Quality Control**

1. Verify decimal sequence integrity
1. Check formatting consistency
1. Validate all cross-references
1. Test content accessibility
1. Update any related indexes or search systems

#### Special Considerations

- Update any references to moved categories
- Maintain links to external resources
- Document source connections to aid recipe creation and internal knowledge transfer (add appropriate metadata about sources, if not self-explanatory, e.g., DOAJ, ArXiv, OJS OAI aggregated)

**Content Alignment**
- Ensure content matches category descriptions (main task)
- Maintain an appropriate depth of categorisation (with an aim for specificity)
- Update any related metadata (ZIM descriptions and metadata)

## Community Tag Uniformisation and Moderation Policy

### Purpose

**To maintain a clean, organised, and efficient tagging system that improves content discoverability and user experience. This protocol ensures consistency in the format, relevance, and management of user-generated tags, also known as community tags.**

### Guidelines for Creating Tags

#### A. General Formatting Rules

**Case Sensitivity:**
All tags must be in lowercase (e.g., `artificial intelligence`, not `Artificial Intelligence`).

**Language:**
Tags should be in the platform's primary language. If multilingual tagging is allowed, tags must be language-specific (e.g., `python-programming` for English, `programmation-python` for French).

**Length:**
Avoid excessively long tags. Ideal tags are between 2 and 4 words. (e.g., `data science`, not a `very detailed description of data science`).

**Punctuation:**
Use hyphens (-) to separate words instead of spaces, underscores, or special characters (e.g., `machine-learning`, not `machine learning` or `machine_learning`).

**No Redundancy:**
Do not create multiple tags for the same concept (e.g., `ai`, `artificial-intelligence`, and `ai-research` should be standardised to `artificial-intelligence`).

**Avoid Special Characters:**
Tags should not contain symbols, numbers (unless essential), or emojis (e.g., `web-3` is acceptable if it references a technology, but `catsüê±` is not).

#### B. Relevance and Specificity

**Be Specific:**
Tags should focus on a single concept or category (e.g., `mobile-development` rather than just `development`).

**Avoid Generic Tags:**
Overly broad terms like `interesting`, `helpful`, or `miscellaneous` are not allowed.

**Context Matters:**
Tags must be directly relevant to the content they describe. Irrelevant tags dilute the system's effectiveness.

**Avoid Personal or Temporal References:**
Do not use tags like `my-favorites`, `2025`, or `current-issues`.


### 3. Guidelines for Reviewing and Moderating ‚ÄúCommunity‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrowd-Sourced‚Äù Tags

#### A. Moderators‚Äô Responsibilities

**Merging Tags:**
Consolidate redundant tags into a single, accepted format (e.g., merge `ai`, `ai-research`, and `artificial-intelligence` into `artificial-intelligence`).

**Deleting Irrelevant Tags:**
Remove vulgar, offensive, irrelevant, spammy, or too vague tags.

**Approving New Tags:**
Only approve new tags that align with this policy and fill a genuine gap in the tagging system.

#### B. Possible future tools for moderation

**Tag Dictionary:**
Create a central dictionary of pre-approved tags for common topics. Use it to guide users and moderators.

**Community Tag Uniformization ProtocolTag Suggestion:**
Implement an auto-suggestion feature to help users select existing tags instead of creating new ones. Provide clear, user-friendly instructions on tagging when users create or edit content.

**Tag Synonyms:**
Define synonyms or aliases in the system. For example, queries for ai should automatically redirect to `artificial-intelligence`.

### 4. Ongoing Maintenance
- The content manager should conduct quarterly reviews to identify and address inconsistencies in the tag database.
- Gather user feedback on the tagging system to refine the protocol. Allow trusted users to flag inappropriate or redundant tags for moderators to review.
- Keep this policy up to date with evolving platform needs and community practices.

### 5. Examples

| Good Tags | Bad Tags | Reason |
|--|--|--|
| `machine-learning` | `ML`, `ml-learning` | Standardised to one the predefined format. |
| `data-visualization` | `dataviz`, `charts` | More descriptive and precise, avoids using word fragments. |
| `climate-change` | `environment` | Relevant and specific to the topic. |
