Data and tools about content (ZIMs) classification

This is a WIP effort to develop a standard, datasets, procedures and tools regarding the classsification of ZIMs.

Late 2024 @doubletkovacs delivered a [foundational document](./KCCS-Jan2025.md) laying-out this effort. This is going to be transformed into an globaly approved standard at organization level (some wording or practices might change), and then datasets, procedures and tools.
